    info: 'Pizza Margherita in 3 easy steps',
    ingredients: '300g strong bread flour' ,
    ingredients1: '1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)',
    ingredients2: '100ml passata',
    ingredients3: '125g ball mozzarella, sliced',
    ingredients4: '1 garlic clove, crushed',
    ingredients5: 'cheese',
    step1:'Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.'
    ,step2:'Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base',
    step3:'Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.'
